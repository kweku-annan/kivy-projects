# Data Collector.

This is a small utility desktop app created with Python Kivy. 

I initially did this with Python's tkinter module. And now, I have used kivy to modify it.

The app is used to collect some basic data about attendees of an event. It then stores the data
collected in a csv file, under the columns: First name, Surname, Contact, Email and Location.

This is not a finished project. Updates will come soon.
